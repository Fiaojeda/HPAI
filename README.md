The Cornell College of Veterinary Medicine provides this dashboard for informative and research purposes only, with no guarantees of accuracy or reliability,
no liability for any resulting loss or damage, and no responsibility for third-party data included.

This dashboard provides up-to-date information on Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) cases across wildlife,
domestic animals, and humans in the United States (US). Our goal is to inform both the general public and the scientific
community about HPAI occurrences through a One Health perspective, recognizing the interconnectedness of human, animal,
and environmental health. The development of the HPAI dashboard was a collaborative effort from faculty and staff from the
Department of Public & Ecosystem Health at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine.
